      "Relocation to the UK has significantly decreased over the last several years from the EU due to various factors; exchange rates, opportunities within their own country, more local options within the EU to name a few. This has had a significant impact on the available workforce in the UK for skilled and non-skilled workforce so where does the solution lie? ",

      "The options of relocating workers from Outside the UK/EU have significant differences including costs and processes. Each Country outside the EU will have slightly different variations, some will require an IELTS certificate to prove their level of English at a reasonable standard whilst the UK will allow other countries to supply candidates to the UK if they have a higher level of education partly completed in English.",
      "Relocating potential employees to the UK depends on each companies starting point and can be from 6 weeks to 3 months. The investment required verses productivity and reliability alone has significantly changed previous clients supplied and abled to spend time on developing employees rather than replacing overworked but loyal employees.",
